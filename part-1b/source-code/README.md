# Source Code

## Overview

The source code comes into below four deliverables:

1. Python code to produce a text file with one utterance per line in the format dialog_act utterance_content

2. Python code that implements a keyword matching baseline

3. Python code that implements a dialog act distribution baseline

4. Python code that implements a machine learning classifier

## Setup

To run the python code that implements a machine learning classifier, the prerequisite is to install Python Keras module:

```
pip3 install keras
pip3 install tensorflow
```
